# Todo List

This is a Todo List web app I created. Users can login using Gmail and add items to their Todo List. Items can have a status of "Not Started", "In Progress" or "Completed". Items can also be deleted.

I built this web app using React. I used Create React App to get started. Data is stored in a JSON NodeJS API with an Express server. User authentication is configured using Google Firebase.

## Installation
```cd todo-list/client
npm install
cd ..
yarn install
yarn dev
```
